Familiar yet refreshingly different, the ‘90s-inspired indie rock sound reappears in a new guise. Layers of dreamy guitars and driving rhythms convey the song’s optimistic message: everything we lack already exists, here and now. And for those paying attention, the rewards are plenty. This is the sentiment Samt Martin delivers with striking ease, before the song crescendos into a shoegaze-like finale, bursting with energy.","title":"New Release: Samt Martin - Antennen auf Empfang","youtube":null,"image":"images/releases/sm-antennen/cover.jpg","links":[{"text":"bandcamp","url":"https://samtmartin.bandcamp.com/track/antennen-auf-empfang"},{"text":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4QxZ4jXMC0rQJiWnsh0FqZ?si=MfsFvVh8TICfByVMxGHiEA"}]}},{"node":{"id":"dcaf0dba-17c6-5aa4-8f7f-7d6ca60d38b0","date":"2025/01/04","description":"Grantsalat 2 is out now. it is available as download and on recycled audio cassettes.","title":"New Release: Grantsalat 2","youtube":null,"image":"images/releases/grantsalat2/cover.jpg","links":[{"text":"bandcamp","url":"https://grantlerrecords.bandcamp.com/album/grantsalat-2"}]}},{"node":{"id":"7aee8c8e-f3b9-5af3-8b64-8ec56f81bced","date":"2023/12/27","description":"we are happy to announce the release of Grantsalat 1. it is available as download and on recycled audio cassettes. each of them is a handcrafted unique piece filled with music from people who often recorded it with limited resources and a lot of passion","title":"New Release: Grantsalat 1","youtube":null,"image":"images/releases/grantsalat1/cover.jpg","links":[{"text":"bandcamp","url":"https://grantlerrecords.bandcamp.com/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"740c3776-3e54-57ca-b5c8-3a649c1fab0b","date":"2023/01/13","description":"silent sex will play a live coding set today at the end of the future at stadtwerkstatt linz.","title":"silent sex - ouvertuere in e moll","youtube":null,"image":null,"links":[]}},{"node":{"id":"08c37723-4aa5-533e-b67f-d39043c14981","date":"2020/08/28","description":"and yet another Lens Arc (re)release. please feel free to message us if you are interested in tapes.","title":"Lens Arc - Monolith / Receptor","youtube":null,"image":null,"links":[{"text":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1oGvdKnOXA0phE3rDxM7VB?si=b8dOcYLzRQGs0tUVX44lDw"},{"text":"bandcamp","url":"https://lensarc.bandcamp.com/album/monolith-receptor"}]}},{"node":{"id":"20400c0f-89d6-5829-ac58-22a1618d4983","date":"2020/07/25","description":"we are happy to re-release Paper Walls by Lens Arc. it is available on all major streaming services. and on tape.","title":"Lens Arc - Paper Walls","youtube":"jNDiJ3wY1GA","image":null,"links":[{"text":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2GGlV0dW3GtYaoFz0iJux7?si=IOvWJ0qnRcmhAlaC63cDFQ"},{"text":"bandcamp","url":"https://lensarc.bandcamp.com/album/paper-walls"}]}},{"node":{"id":"e5c8f26f-e9d1-52e8-8cf1-bf1d683c234b","date":"2020/03/22","description":"more content is hopefully coming soon.","title":"coming soon","youtube":null,"image":null,"links":null}},{"node":{"id":"da62ea39-47d2-5961-9954-4622ddcc5dbf","date":"2020/03/22","description":"we are happy to announce that we are finally alive.","title":"hello world","youtube":null,"image":null,"links":null}}]}}}
