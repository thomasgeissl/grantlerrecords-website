His music aspires to be a nit-picked blend of sounds from various inspirations, like the warbled guitars of shoegaze with a droning voice drenched in dark reverb, some hazy ambient synths borrowed from 80s new age albums and the hypnagogic lofi-ness of early 2010s Bandcamp psych pop tapes.","image":"/images/artists/lens_arc/artist.jpg","links":[{"text":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/3UlXKqf3EIG9MFrfnaazD1?si=JT7I4TKnQKSVK0sG8FAXXw"},{"text":"bandcamp","url":"https://lensarc.bandcamp.com/"}],"releases":[{"title":"Paper Walls","image":"/images/artists/lens_arc/releases/paper_walls.jpg"},{"title":"Monolith / Receptor","image":"/images/artists/lens_arc/releases/monolith_receptor.jpg"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2191033684","3649515864"]}
