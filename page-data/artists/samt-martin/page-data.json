Layers of dreamy guitars and driving rhythms give rise to modern themes: of everyday yearning and letting go, of new beginnings and living in the moment. Wooden hearts and monuments of lead are joined by androids, songbirds, and ghosts, offering a playful wink from the band’s multifaceted songs. With one foot in the past and their gaze always fixed forward, Samt Martin uniquely blends musical nostalgia with emotional utopia. After all, everything stays the same – as long as it keeps changing.","image":"/images/artists/samt_martin/artist.jpg","links":[{"text":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/22jMoawsR2u3MjE3wnvUZC?si=Ys96dpEETRCyRMflucgQgA"},{"text":"bandcamp","url":"https://samtmartin.bandcamp.com/"}],"releases":[{"title":"Antennen auf Empfang","image":"/images/artists/samt_martin/releases/antennen_auf_empfang.jpg"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2191033684","3649515864"]}
