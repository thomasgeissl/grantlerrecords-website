        "description": "Lens Arc is the name that Thomas Haida, originally from a tiny village in Bavaria and now residing in Berlin, has chosen for his musical outlet -- with everything made by himself in the various bedrooms that he has physically occupied over time (and most of the time). His music aspires to be a nit-picked blend of sounds from various inspirations, like the warbled guitars of shoegaze with a droning voice drenched in dark reverb, some hazy ambient synths borrowed from 80s new age albums and the hypnagogic lofi-ness of early 2010s Bandcamp psych pop tapes.",
