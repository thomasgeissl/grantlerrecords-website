    "date": "2025/02/14",
    "description": "Berlin-based band Samt Martin is sending out a clear signal to the world with the release of their debut single, Antennen auf Empfang. Familiar yet refreshingly different, the ‘90s-inspired indie rock sound reappears in a new guise. Layers of dreamy guitars and driving rhythms convey the song’s optimistic message: everything we lack already exists, here and now. And for those paying attention, the rewards are plenty. This is the sentiment Samt Martin delivers with striking ease, before the song crescendos into a shoegaze-like finale, bursting with energy.",
